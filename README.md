# Exchange rates app
A sample app querying the Metatrader API, using Retrofit2, the Moshi converter, and the new reactive Android Architecture Components  

Initially the project started out using RxJava2; however, trying to combine it with Arch Components it quickly became a mess. Implementation using only the latter is cleaner.
